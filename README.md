# NAMD with EPC

This is a program to perform non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simultion
in momentum space, where the non-adiabatic couplings (NACs) are replaced by
electron-phonon (*e-ph*) couplings (EPCs).

The codes are based on [Hefei-NAMD](https://github.com/QijingZheng/Hefei-NAMD)
developed by [Qijing Zheng](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~zqj), et al.
