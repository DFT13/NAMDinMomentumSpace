This project is designed to perform non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simultion in momentum space, in which the non-adiabatic couplings (NACs) are replaced by electron-phonon (e-p) interaction matrix.

The code is based on the namd code written by Qijing Zheng from USTC.

Version 1.0.0
Read epc data from QE & EPW package, Read MD trajectory from VASP for phonon decomposition.
Then caculate couplings from e-p interation to replace the NA couplings.
To use e-p couplings, you need set LEPC=.TRUE. and NKPOINTS in inp file, and for INICON file, you should add a third line to specify initial k point.
